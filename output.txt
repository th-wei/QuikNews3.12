U.S. infrastructure investing is becoming unstable, particularly when it comes to renewable energy projects.Driving the news: The Trump administration last week ordered a stop to work on an offshore wind farm in Rhode Island, even though 65 of the 85 turbines already are installed.No federal funds are being used for "Revolution Wind," which instead is a joint venture between Denmark's Ã˜rsted and a portfolio company of Global Infrastructure Partners (now owned by BlackRock). It's designed to provide power to around 350,000 homes, and was fully permitted.A letter from the U.S. Interior Department cited vague national security concerns, and could result in litigation if not rescinded.Ã˜rsted is still calculating its economic damages, but a similar Trump action in New York cost that operator at least $50 million per week.Elsewhere: Trump also plans to pull existing permits for a planned wind project in Maryland, which is partially owned by Apollo Global Management and expected to power over 700,000 homes.The big picture: All of this could have a chilling effect on private equity investment in U.S. infrastructure projects, and thus on the U.S. economy and global competitiveness.Firms won't be willing to put big money into the ground when it can shift so capriciously. Not just for wind projects â€” which Trump has loudly opposed since turbines were permitted near his Scotland golf course â€” but also for solar, EV charging, and even more traditional infrastructure like bridges and roads. And that goes double for any project that includes federal funds.By the numbers: Global investing in renewable energy hit a new record in the first half of 2025, but fell by 36% in the U.S., as my Axios colleague Ben Geman recently reported.The bottom line: Infrastructure investing is long-term by nature, and investors must be able to trust government promises.Can you even begin a new nuclear or fossil fuel project today when the next president might oppose it, and view Trump's actions as precedent?An "all-in" energy policy is impossible to implement when the money is moving out.

The BFD

Bain Capital is seeking to sell luxury parka maker Canada Goose (NYSE: GOOS), but I'm hearing that a formal bidding process hasn't yet begun.Why it's the BFD: This comes as consumers are being more circumspect about high-priced purchases.Catch up quick: Bain holds nearly a 32% stake in Canada Goose, which it took public in 2017, and a majority of voting shares.It hired Goldman Sachs earlier this year to launch an auction, and CNBC last night reported that it had received offers valued at around $1.35 billion from private equity firms Advent International and Boyu Capital.That report sent Canada Goose shares soaring more than 13% at today's open, but a source close to the situation says that no actual bids have been submitted yet. No word on when bids would be due, and it does seem accurate that both Advent and Boyu are in the data room.By the numbers: Toronto-based Canada Goose reported higher profits of C$95 million for the year ending March 31, 2025, on relatively flat revenue of C$1.35 billion. In Q2, its year-over-year revenue was down 6%.The bottom line: Bain's sell decision seems to be more a function of time than tariffs, as Canada Goose says 75% of its items are produced in Canada and compliant with the USMCA.
