 Top of the Morning

The NBA ownership carousel kept spinning yesterday, with private equity billionaire Tom Dundon agreeing to buy the Portland Trailblazers for just over $4 billion from Paul Allen's estate.

The league also approved Bill Chisholm's purchase of the Boston Celtics, which was announced back in March.
Here are four things to know about the Blazers deal, based on conversations with sources familiar:1. Dundon doesn't yet have all the money.

He does have several partners officially in the door, including Blue Owl co-president Mark Zahr and Portland-based venture capitalist Sheel Tyle.
But he's also trying to fill out the syndicate, which could include private equity participation. This isn't unusual — Chisholm needed to do the same after agreeing to buy the Celtics — and is unlikely to become an obstacle, particularly given that it was said to be a "highly competitive" bidding process.
One thing to watch will be if there's any involvement by Blue Owl, whose Dyal unit has minority stakes in several other clubs, or if its role will be limited to Zahr as an individual. Also unclear if Zahr's day job would impact his potential ability to serve as an alternate governor for the Blazers.
2. There's no real estate involved, just as there wasn't for the Celtics or Lakers deals. So when calculating future team sales, these might be viewed as discounted comps.

The Trailblazers last year sold their arena and underlying property to the city of Portland for just $7 million, and extended their lease through 2030.
The goal was to enable renovation, particularly with a new WNBA club to begin play in Portland next year.
But NBA commissioner Adam Silver has said that "Portland likely needs a new arena," which obviously has some locals worried about losing their team to Las Vegas or some other city. There are other available locations, such as an old shopping mall site called Lloyd Center — although the availability of public financing is much more questionable.
3. Dallas-based Dundon is saying the right things about keeping the team in Portland.

When Dundon bought the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes in 2018, he kept the club in Raleigh (where he's also been trying to lure a Major League Baseball team). He also spent big to renovate the team's arena and surrounding area.
That said, Dundon could come under relocation pressures in Portland if the city doesn't cough up cash — and the relatively short-term lease will give him leverage.
4. Game over.

No other NBA teams are actively seeking to sell control stakes, after a two-year flurry that's included Portland, Boston, Los Angeles, Dallas, Minnesota, Phoenix, and Charlotte.
That said, the Lakers sale was on a proprietary basis between the Buss family and Mark Walter, so it's possible that sort of deal could be quietly in the works. Or that the high price Portland just fetched will induce a reticent owner to solicit bids.

Centrica (LSE: CNA) and Energy Capital Partners have agreed to jointly buy the Grain LNG terminal near London from National Grid (NYSE: NGC) for around $2.04 billion.Why it's the BFD: Grain LNG is Europe's largest liquefied natural gas import terminal, at a time when demand is soaring due to Russia's war in Ukraine.The bottom line: "National Grid said in March 2024 it planned to sell the site, as well as its U.S. onshore renewables arm, to focus on its electricity networks business. It started the formal divestment process in April." — The Financial Times

 Final Numbers 

 Data: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Chart: Axios Visuals
 Wholesale inflation hit a three-year high in July, with the Producer Price Index rising a much hotter-than-expected 0.9%.Why it matters: This could give the Fed second thoughts about cutting rates next month.

Stocks fell and bond yields rose on the news.
Zoom in: PPI is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is the same agency responsible for monthly jobs and Consumer Price Index readings.

Thus far, no accusations from President Trump that the PPI data was rigged.

Today: Why bullish investors are worried about near-term pain.
Plus: How artificial intelligence is pushing up your power bills.

 1 big thing: Summertime and investors are uneasy 

 By Madison Mills 

 Illustration: Shoshana Gordon/Axios

Investors, after driving stocks to record highs, are now starting to lose their appetite for risk, the S&P Global Investment Manager Index survey finds.Why it matters: High valuations and continued uncertainty over tariffs are making investors more skittish. Plus we're also getting deeper into August and soon September, historically weak months for stocks.

That could be a recipe for a near-term pullback.
By the numbers: Investor sentiment in August hit its lowest level since April, highlighting "a worsening near-term equity outlook" and "increased political uncertainty affecting market dynamics," the S&P analysis shows.

The last time U.S. investor risk appetite was this low was April, when markets hit an intraday bear market off the back of record high tariff announcements.
The Investment Manager Index that shows expectations for market performance fell to negative 35% in August from negative 5% in July.
What they're saying: "We expect investors to look through near-term weakness to focus on a 2026 recovery," Sitara Sundar, head of alternative investment strategy and market intelligence at JPMorgan, writes in a note.

Indeed, investors have become increasingly bullish about 2026, as they anticipate interest rate cuts combined with earnings growth.
The next four months, however, are less rosy, with Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Evercore ISI all calling for a near-term pullback.
Yes, but: Anyone who got out of the market in April is eager to rush in to buy any dips. And in a market defined by dip buying, how bad could a near-term pullback really get?

Ever since April, the market has declined by more than 1% for the day only one time, which signals that investors are flocking in to buy any weakness.
What we're watching: How is an increased aversion to risk playing out?

Stocks just grind higher.
The bond market has remained calm since its April "yips."
Crypto, a measure of risk-on sentiment, is hitting record highs.
The VIX, a measure of volatility, has remained historically muted.
Zoom in: On a sector basis, investors are net bullish on financials, communication services and information technology, S&P notes.

Bullishness in IT still decreased substantially in part due to semiconductor tariff announcements. Consumer discretionary is the sector with the most bearish views, reversing the bullish sentiment that built up during July.
The bottom line: Consensus earnings per share for the S&P 500 is expected to come in at $300 in 2026, rising from an expected $267 per share in 2025, which means that investors still see upside.

But the road there will not necessarily be smooth.

 2. How gas and power prices became political 

 By Ben Geman 

 Data: Bureau of Labor Statistics. Chart: Axios Visuals
 Average costs to power homes have been trending upward while gasoline costs have moved largely the other way, Labor Department data shows.Why it matters: Steadily rising demand from artificial intelligence, heat, an increasingly electrifying economy, and more are all pushing up power bills.The intrigue: It all makes the politics of energy prices heading into the 2026 midterms worth watching.

Democrats and green groups hope to impose a political cost for rising electricity bills. They say in speeches and ads that killing renewables subsidies in the budget law will send prices higher.
Trump administration officials, meanwhile, say they are unshackling government policy constraints on fossil fuels to keep prices in check.
What we're watching: The independent stats arm at the Energy Department estimates residential power costs up 4% in 2025 to 17 cents per kilowatt-hour.

The Energy Information Administration outlook released Tuesday estimates another rise to 18 cents per kilowatt-hour next year.
Yes, but: Gasoline prices are going the other way amid ample oil supplies and rather tepid global oil demand growth.

The nationwide average retail price is projected to be be $2.90 per gallon next year, around 6% less than 2025.
What's next: The diverging costs set up a political experiment.

If trends hold, what matters more to Republicans as they try to keep control of Congress? Higher bills to keep the lights on or lower costs to fill up?
One thing to keep in mind is that gasoline costs are very visible and are typically incurred more often than regular electricity payments.
Lots of homes are heated with natural gas, too, and a slight rise in residential prices this year and slight dip next year is expected.

 3. Market breadth becomes better for investors 

 By Madison Mills 

 Screenshot: @LJKawa via X/Bloomberg

For the first time since April, more than 300 stocks closed in the green consecutively, meaning over half of stocks were up two days in a row.Why it matters: Concentration concerns are part of what plagues the near-term outlook. So if market strength can broaden beyond the top tech stocks, that's a bullish signal.By the numbers: The top 20 stocks in the S&P 500 now account for half of the total index on a market cap basis.

A decade ago, the top 20 stocks only accounted for 29% of the market.
Between the lines: That's a sign of bad market breadth.

When the market becomes too concentrated into one basket of stocks (in this case tech) it's risky. If anything upsets that basket, the whole market can get whipsawed.
Zoom in: As investors price in a quarter-point cut in interest rates at the Federal Reserve's next meeting in September, they seem to be pricing in a broadening of strength across the stock market as well.The bottom line: As rates come down, the market's reliance on tech stocks may be able to subside, a positive development for investors.

☀️ Happy Thursday! Smart Brevity™ count: 1,487 words ... 5½ mins. Thanks to Noah Bressner for orchestrating. Copy edited by Bryan McBournie.🦾 Axios' AI+ Summit returns to D.C. on Sept. 17.

 1 big thing: CEOs strike back 

 Illustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios

CEOs are pushing to reset workplace culture — emphasizing productivity and speed over flexibility and work-life balance, Axios' Eleanor Hawkins writes.

Why it matters: This 180-degree turn from the pandemic years is putting employees on guard, with some feeling like a more hardcore culture is the opposite of what they signed up for.
The big picture: CEOs across industries are embracing the "Big Boss Era," which has been underscored by mass layoffs, return-to-office mandates and walkbacks on DEI initiatives.

Macro factors, including the softening job market and the threat of AI eliminating jobs, have employees on edge.
🔬 Zoom in: AT&T CEO John Stankey and Cognition CEO Scott Wu made headlines this month for notifying employees that their corporate cultures were changing, and to get on board or exit.

"If a self-directed, virtual, or hybrid work schedule is essential for you to manage your career aspirations and life challenges, you will have a difficult time aligning your priorities with those of the company and the culture we aim to establish," Stankey wrote in an internal memo obtained by Business Insider.
Employees at Cognition, an AI startup, were told that six days in the office and 80-hour workweeks were expected, according to The Information. "We don't believe in work-life balance — building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn't possibly separate the two," Wu wrote ($).
Between the lines: Return to office continues to be one of the biggest sticking points.

Nearly half of workers say they are unlikely to stay at their job if required to go back into the office full time, according to a Pew poll.
If given the choice, a majority (72%) say they'd choose a hybrid arrangement.

 2. 🔎 Scoop: White House's close eye on Lewandowski 

 Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and adviser Corey Lewandowski during a visit to Guatemala in June. Photo: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images
 Corey Lewandowski doesn't want to clock out of his temporary government gig. So, administration officials believe, he's avoiding clocking in, Axios' Brittany Gibson and Marc Caputo write.

Why it matters: Lewandowski, a longtime and controversial Trump adviser, is wielding outsized influence at the Department of Homeland Security as a "special government employee" whose work is supposed to be temporary.
Administration officials tell Axios they believe Lewandowski — a constant presence with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who acts as her de facto chief of staff — has gamed the system by undercounting his work hours to avoid leaving his unpaid job when he should have.

White House officials began monitoring Lewandowski's time at work in recent weeks, Axios has learned.
🔭 Zoom in: Special government employees, known as SGEs, are limited to 130 days per year of unpaid work. Like recent SGE Elon Musk, they can be in senior positions and still have private employment and clients, unlike typical government workers.

The department told Axios he has worked only 69 days since he was hired shortly after Noem's Jan. 25 confirmation.
Four administration sources tell Axios they believe that's a gross undercount, and that he's exceeded his allowed time.
🧐 The intrigue: Lewandowski's work at DHS has attracted media attention because of his close relationship with Noem. The two, married to others, have long denied rumors they're romantically involved.

But concerns about their relationship led President Trump to nix the idea of allowing Noem to make Lewandowski her chief of staff.
"Everybody's scared sh*tless" of Lewandowski, a former DHS official told Axios. "The feeling is that if they go up against Corey, they're going to lose. And I would have to say they're right."

 3. 🏔️ Trump raises summit stakes

 President Trump just upped the ante for tomorrow's summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin — both for the war in Ukraine and his own credibility, Axios' Dave Lawler and Marc Caputo write.

Three advisers who've been in the room as Trump discussed the summit are adamant he's not bluffing.
Why it matters: This is no longer just a "feel-out meeting," as Trump originally labeled it.

He privately told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and NATO leaders that his goal was a ceasefire, and then publicly threatened Putin with "very severe consequences" if he doesn't agree to stop the fighting.
A senior U.S. official told Axios: "This is Trump being the most serious he has ever been and the most direct. He wants to show the world."

"Now the onus is on Putin: Agree to a ceasefire or show real movement or there will be severe repercussions. Putin has to show very positive movement."
Between the lines: Trump threatened "serious consequences" if Putin didn't agree to a ceasefire by last Friday, only to change course when Putin proposed a meeting.

A second U.S. official insisted this time is different — that Putin "tapped Trump along," then requested this meeting, and now he has to deliver.

 4. 📉 Border crime drop 

 Illustration: Maura Losch/Axios

Several U.S. border communities saw violent crime drop below the national average in 2024, Axios' Russell Contreras writes from an analysis of new FBI data.

Why it matters: The findings from last year run counter to claims by President Trump and GOP leaders, who painted border towns as crime hotspots because of newly arrived immigrants.
🧮 By the numbers: Eleven border cities examined annually by Axios — Brownsville, McAllen, Laredo, Eagle Pass, Del Rio and El Paso in Texas; Sunland Park in New Mexico; Nogales and Yuma in Arizona; and Calexico and San Diego in California — had an average violent crime rate of 356.5 per 100,000 residents.

That was a sizable drop from 2023 and was slightly below the national average of 359.1 per 100,000 residents last year.
Early numbers for 2025 indicate that overall violent crime in the border cities is continuing to drop, as Trump's lockdown of the border has greatly reduced illegal crossings.

 5. 🇮🇱 Israel courts MAGA influencers

The Israeli government is courting popular MAGA influencers in an effort to address Republican divisions over the war in Gaza, where scenes of violence and starvation have fueled global outrage, Axios' Tal Axelrod writes.

Why it matters: U.S. support for Israel's military actions has fallen to record lows. Even within the traditionally pro-Israel GOP, younger Republicans are increasingly skeptical — questioning both the alliance and the billions in U.S. aid that sustain it.
Zoom in: Fifteen MAGA influencers visited Israel this week on a trip organized by Israel365, an advocacy group that aims to "strengthen Israel by building bridges between Jews, Christians and all who share our faith-based values."

Israel365 was awarded a no-bid contract worth $70,000 by the Israeli Foreign Ministry to organize the trip, according to a Foreign Ministry memo obtained by Axios.
👀 The intrigue: Steve Bannon's "War Room" podcast parted ways with MAGA influencer Jayne Zirkle over her participation in the government-funded trip.

 6. 🗽 Mamdani's mantra: "No translation" 

 Cover: TIME

Zohran Mamdani, NYC's 33-year-old Democratic nominee for mayor, lays out his theory of the case in a TIME cover profile (live soon) out this morning:

 "I think the larger struggle for us as Democrats is to ensure that we are practicing a politics that is direct, a politics of no translation, a politics that when you read the policy commitment, you understand it, as how it applies to your life."
 👀 Former President Obama's orbit has taken an interest in Mamdani even as much of the Democratic establishment has shied away, N.Y. Times opinion columnist Mara Gay writes (gift link)

Obama himself talked to Mamdani in a lengthy call in June. David Axelrod, an architect of Obama's meteoric rise, met the candidate in person at his campaign headquarters.
Former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau and former senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer have been in touch with one of his closest aides.

Interest in breeding smarter babies is peaking in Silicon Valley, The Wall Street Journal writes:

"Parents here are paying up to $50,000 for new genetic-testing services that include promises to screen embryos for IQ. Tech futurists such as Elon Musk are urging the intellectually gifted to multiply, while professional matchmakers are setting up tech execs with brilliant partners partly to get brilliant offspring.
"'Right now I have one, two, three tech CEOs and all of them prefer Ivy League,' said Jennifer Donnelly, a high-end matchmaker who charges up to $500,000."
