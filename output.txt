NEWSLETTER 1
Thank you for subscribing to Axios Pro Rata!Hello, Thank you for subscribing to Axios Pro Rata! I'm Dan Primack, the author of Axios Pro Rata, and I'm excited to dive into the world of deal-makers with you. 
To ensure the newsletter reaches your inbox, add dan@axios.com to your contacts. If you use Gmail, just drag this email to your "Primary" tab. For other mail clients, check out this page.
A little about me: I've been a business reporter for over 20 years, primarily focused on deals and deal-makers.Before helping to launch Axios, I created the Term Sheet newsletter at Fortune and PE Hub at Thomson Reuters.
My goal is to write for insiders, but make outsiders understand why these transactions matter beyond the dollars and cents. What's next: Axios Pro Rata publishes daily Monday through Friday and your first edition will be in your inbox soon.
Any tips, questions, feedback or stories you want to see covered, send me an email: dan@axios.com. Better yet, when the next edition hits your inbox, you can reach me by replying directly.
And finally, help me spread the word. Tell everyone you know to sign up for Axios Pro Rata here. All the best,Dan
