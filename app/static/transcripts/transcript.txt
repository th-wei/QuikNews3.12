<Person1>Welcome to Daily Metis News - Keep up with Metis on tech and business.
</Person1><Person2>And we have a major story to kick things off today. U.S. infrastructure investing is facing some serious headwinds.
</Person2><Person1>That's right. The big news is the Trump administration ordering a complete stop to work on an offshore wind farm in Rhode Island. And get this, it was almost done!
</Person1><Person2>Almost done is an understatement! We're talking 65 of the 85 turbines were already installed! This project, "Revolution Wind," is a joint venture between Denmark's Ørsted and a company owned by BlackRock of all places.
</Person2><Person1>And to be clear, no federal funds are being used here. This is a private project designed to power around 350,000 homes. It was fully permitted, everything was supposedly good to go.
</Person1><Person2>So what's the reason? Why pull the plug at the eleventh hour?
</Person2><Person1>The letter from the Interior Department cited… and I'm quoting here… "vague national security concerns."
</Person1><Person2>Wow. "Vague national security concerns." That feels like a catch-all for anything. This is going to end up in court, isn't it?
</Person2><Person1>Almost certainly. Ørsted is still calculating the economic damages, but a similar action in New York cost that operator at least 50 million dollars a week!
</Person1><Person2>Fifty million! That's staggering. And it’s not an isolated incident, right? I heard about another project in Maryland.
</Person2><Person1>Exactly. There are plans to pull existing permits for a wind project there too. That one is partially owned by Apollo Global Management and was expected to power over 700,000 homes.
</Person1><Person2>This is the real story here. It's the chilling effect this has on private investment. If you're a P.E. firm, why would you put billions of dollars into the ground for a project that takes years to build, if the government can just capriciously change its mind?
</Person2><Person1>It's not just wind, either. This could scare away money from solar, E.V. charging, even traditional things like bridges and roads. The data already shows it. Global investing in renewables hit a new record in the first half of 2025, but in the U.S., it fell by 36%.
</Person1><Person2>There's your reason why. Infrastructure is a long-term game. Investors absolutely have to be able to trust government promises. You can't have an "all-in" energy policy when the money is all moving out.
</Person2><Person1>Okay, shifting gears from energy policy to luxury outerwear. There’s a lot of chatter around Canada Goose.
</Person1><Person2>Ah yes, Bain Capital is looking to sell. Is this a good time, though? Consumers are being a lot more careful with high-priced purchases these days.
</Person2><Person1>Well, that's the interesting part. C.N.B.C. reported that Bain had received offers around 1.35 billion dollars from private equity firms Advent International and Boyu Capital. That sent the stock soaring more than 13%!
</Person1><Person2>So the deal is basically done?
</Person2><Person1>Not so fast. A source close to the situation says that no actual bids have been submitted yet. It seems Advent and Boyu are in the data room, they're looking, but a formal bidding process hasn't even begun.
</Person1><Person2>That's a classic case of the market getting ahead of itself. So why is Bain selling now? Are they worried about the numbers?
</Person2><Person1>The numbers are a mixed bag. For the year ending in March, profits were actually up to 95 million Canadian dollars, but revenue was relatively flat. And in the second quarter, year-over-year revenue was down 6%.
</Person1><Person2>I see. So it's not a clear-cut growth story. My guess is this is less about performance and more about timing. Bain took the company public back in 2017. It's just time for them to exit the investment, you know, it’s the natural lifecycle of a private equity hold.
</Person2><Person1>That makes sense. And the company says 75% of its items are produced in Canada, so it's not really about tariffs. It's just time to sell.
</Person1><Person2>Alright, let's hit the deal-flow. What’s happening in Venture Capital?
</Person2><Person1>A lot! Attio, a C.R.M. startup out of London, raised a 52 million dollar Series B led by G.V.
</Person1><Person2>And health tech is still on fire. Assort Health, which automates patient communications, raised 50 million in a Series B at a 750 million dollar valuation!
</Person2><Person1>That is a huge valuation. Also in health, Therna Biosciences raised 10 million for R.N.A.-based medicines, and Leal Therapeutics raised 30 million for neurology drugs.
</Person1><Person2>And I saw a really interesting A.I. deal. Vox A.I., a Dutch startup, raised almost 9 million dollars. They make conversational A.I. specifically for quick-serve restaurants.
</Person2><Person1>That's a fantastic niche. On the Private Equity side, T.P.G. agreed to acquire Irth Solutions from Blackstone. They provide enterprise software for energy and infrastructure companies.
</Person1><Person2>That's a big one. And it ties right back to our lead story. Even with the political instability, the backend software that runs these massive companies is still a hot commodity.
</Person2><Person1>Definitely. And what about companies going public?
</Person1><Person2>The big rumor is that Crypto-dot-com has met with bankers about an I.P.O. After their recent crypto treasury launch with Trump Media, that would be a… fascinating public offering to watch.
</Person2><Person1>Fascinating is one word for it! That's all the time we have for today. From unstable energy policy to big moves in retail and tech, a lot is happening.
</Person1><Person2>Absolutely. That infrastructure story is the one to keep a very close eye on. The long-term implications are huge.
